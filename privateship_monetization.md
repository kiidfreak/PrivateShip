# PrivateShip Monetization Strategy

## 🎯 Core Principle

**PrivateShip is trust infrastructure, not a payment processor.**

We make money by **charging for trust verification and proof generation** — the thing payment platforms, marketplaces, and apps need but can't build themselves.

---

## 💰 Revenue Streams (Priority Order)

### 1. **API Usage Fees** (PRIMARY REVENUE - 70%)

**Model:** Pay-per-verification + Pay-per-proof

#### Pricing Tiers

**Free Tier** (Developer/Test)
- 100 verifications/month
- 500 proof validations/month
- Test environment only
- Community support
- **Revenue:** $0 (acquisition funnel)

**Starter** ($99/month)
- 1,000 verifications/month
- 5,000 proof validations/month
- Basic fraud detection
- Email support
- **Target:** Small businesses, WhatsApp sellers
- **Overage:** $0.10/verification

**Growth** ($499/month)
- 10,000 verifications/month
- 50,000 proof validations/month
- Advanced fraud detection
- Real-time webhooks
- Priority support
- **Target:** Growing marketplaces, apps
- **Overage:** $0.08/verification

**Enterprise** (Custom pricing)
- Unlimited verifications
- Dedicated infrastructure
- White-label option
- Custom trust models
- SLA guarantees
- 24/7 support
- **Target:** Major platforms (Jumia, Jiji, banks)
- **Starting at:** $2,999/month

#### Usage-Based Pricing (Pay-as-you-go)

For customers who exceed tier limits:

| Service | Price |
|---------|-------|
| Phone verification (Tier 1) | $0.05 |
| ID verification (Tier 2) | $0.15 |
| Face verification (Tier 3) | $0.25 |
| Trust proof generation | $0.03 |
| Trust proof validation | $0.01 |
| Trust score query | $0.02 |
| Fraud check (deep) | $0.10 |

**Why this works:**
- Low friction (start free)
- Predictable revenue (subscriptions)
- Scales with usage (high-volume customers pay more)
- Gross margin: ~70% (after SMS/OCR costs)

---

### 2. **Trust Score Premium** (SECONDARY - 15%)

**Advanced Risk Intelligence**

Base API includes basic trust score (0-100). Premium adds:

**Risk Intelligence Add-on** ($199/month)
- Real-time fraud monitoring
- Velocity checks (too many attempts)
- Device fingerprinting analysis
- IP reputation scoring
- Duplicate identity detection
- Behavioral anomaly alerts

**Custom Trust Models** (Enterprise only)
- Industry-specific scoring (dating apps, crypto, marketplaces)
- Custom verification requirements
- Tailored fraud rules
- **Price:** $500-2000/month depending on complexity

**Why this works:**
- High-margin (mostly software)
- Sticky (reduces fraud = customers keep paying)
- Upsell opportunity (start basic → upgrade to premium)

---

### 3. **Compliance & Audit Services** (10%)

**For Regulated Industries**

Many businesses need compliance but don't want to build it.

**Compliance Packages:**

**Basic Audit Trail** (Included in Growth+)
- 90-day audit log retention
- CSV export
- Basic reporting

**Compliance Pro** ($299/month)
- 7-year audit log retention (Kenya Data Protection Act)
- Advanced filtering & search
- Automated compliance reports
- GDPR data export tools
- Right-to-be-forgotten automation

**Regulatory Suite** (Enterprise - $999/month)
- All Compliance Pro features
- Custom compliance dashboards
- Regulatory change alerts
- Quarterly compliance reviews
- Legal support (referrals)

**Why this works:**
- Regulation is increasing (Kenya DPA, GDPR, etc.)
- Companies pay for peace of mind
- Sticky (can't easily switch once integrated)
- High perceived value

---

### 4. **White-Label Solution** (5%)

**For platforms that want branded trust**

Some large platforms (banks, major marketplaces) want PrivateShip technology with their own branding.

**White-Label Package:**
- Custom branded dashboard
- Custom trust badge design
- Dedicated infrastructure
- Custom domain (trust.theircompany.com)
- API customization
- Priority feature development

**Pricing:**
- Setup fee: $10,000 (one-time)
- Monthly: $5,000-15,000 (based on volume)
- Revenue share: 20% of verification fees (alternative model)

**Target customers:**
- Banks (KCB, Equity Bank)
- Major marketplaces (Jumia, Jiji)
- Telcos (Safaricom, Airtel)
- Government (eCitizen integration)

**Why this works:**
- Massive deal sizes ($60K-180K/year per customer)
- Long sales cycles but high retention
- Strategic partnerships
- Reference customers for credibility

---

### 5. **Data Insights (Anonymized)** (Future - 5%)

**Aggregate Market Intelligence**

We see trust patterns across platforms. This data is valuable (anonymized).

**Products:**

**Trust Heatmaps** ($500/month)
- Trust score distribution by region
- Fraud hotspots
- Identity verification trends
- Industry benchmarks

**Fraud Pattern Reports** (Quarterly - $2,000)
- Emerging fraud tactics
- Industry-specific insights
- Comparative analysis

**Custom Research** (On-demand)
- Specific market research
- Trust trends analysis
- Competitive intelligence
- **Price:** $5,000-20,000 per project

**Why this works:**
- High margin (data already collected)
- Differentiated offering (nobody else has this data)
- B2B buyers: VCs, market research firms, large enterprises

## 🎯 Monetization Strategy by Customer Segment

### 1. **WhatsApp/Instagram Sellers** (SMB)
**Pain:** Need trust badges but can't afford KYC
**Pitch:** "Get verified for $0. Pay only when customers check your badge."
**Revenue:** Usage-based ($0.02 per badge view)
**CAC:** Low (word-of-mouth, social media)

### 2. **Kenyan Marketplaces** (Growth)
**Pain:** High cart abandonment, fraud losses
**Pitch:** "Reduce fraud by 80%, increase conversions by 40%"
**Revenue:** $499/month + overages
**CAC:** Medium (direct sales, case studies)

### 3. **Fintechs (HoneyCoin, Wave, etc.)** (Enterprise)
**Pain:** KYC is expensive, regulatory burden
**Pitch:** "Outsource trust to us. Focus on payments."
**Revenue:** Custom pricing ($5K-15K/month)
**CAC:** High (partnership sales, pilots)

### 4. **Banks & Telcos** (White-Label)
**Pain:** Need modern identity layer, slow to build
**Pitch:** "Launch in 3 months, not 3 years"
**Revenue:** $10K setup + $5K-15K/month
**CAC:** Very high (RFPs, procurement, compliance)

### 5. **Web3/DAOs** (Future)
**Pain:** Sybil attacks, need proof-of-personhood
**Pitch:** "Sybil resistance without KYC"
**Revenue:** Per-proof pricing ($0.05/proof)
**CAC:** Low (crypto-native distribution)

## 🚨 Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Customers don't want to pay** | Free tier + clear ROI (fraud reduction) |
| **Too expensive for Africa** | 10x cheaper than alternatives |

## 🎯 The Bottom Line

**PrivateShip makes money by being the trust layer fintechs, marketplaces, and apps plug into.**

**Not by:**
- ❌ Processing payments (HoneyCoin does that)
- ❌ Storing funds (custody risk)
- ❌ Issuing cards (operational hell)

**But by:**
- ✅ Verifying identities (pay-per-verification)
- ✅ Generating trust proofs (pay-per-proof)
- ✅ Preventing fraud (premium add-on)
- ✅ Ensuring compliance (enterprise add-on)
- ✅ White-label infrastructure (big deals)

**Revenue Model:** SaaS + Usage-based  
**Target Gross Margin:** 70%  
**CAC Payback:** 3-6 months  
**Expansion Revenue:** High (customers use more over time)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Launch free tier** (Month 1) → Get developers building
2. **First paid customer** (Month 3) → Validate pricing
3. **10 paying customers** (Month 6) → Prove repeatability
4. **$10K MRR** (Month 9) → Raise seed round
5. **$50K MRR** (Month 12) → Hire sales team
6. **$250K MRR** (Month 24) → Series A

---

**The goal: Be acquired by Stripe/HoneyCoin/Checkout.com for $50-100M in 3-5 years.**

**Or:** Build a $1B+ trust infrastructure company (the Plaid/Stripe of identity).

Both paths require the same foundation: **nail the API, nail the pricing, nail the developer experience.**

**PrivateShip: Trust as a Service. Pay per verification. Own your identity.**
